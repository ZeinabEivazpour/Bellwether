Bellwethers in Heterogeneous Transfer Learning
-----
+ There are very few valid metric matches. Average of 1 or 2 metrics.

|    | pde | eq | jdt | lc | ml |
|----|-----|----|-----|----|----|
| cm |     |    |     | 2  |    |
| jm |     |    |     |    |    |
| kc |     |    |     | 1  |    |
| mc |     | 1  |     |    |    |
| mw |     | 1  |     |    |    |

+ And the metrics change with datasets.

+ In many cases there are no matches at all (using the recommended KSAnalyzer)

+ This week, I found embeddings using community bellwethers. Instead of an exhaustive search.

|--------|------------|
| Apache | Lucene     |
| NASA   | MC         |
| ReLink | Safe       |
| AEEEM  | LC         |

+ Match the target dataset to the bellwether to find matching dimensions.
